    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 12th, 2018, I decided to get rid of texting for at least 30 days. Texting causes me all kinds of stress and anxiety, because as a texter, I’m the type to respond quickly and consistently and encourage endless conversation. Most people whom I interact with do not necessarily share the same passion for communication, especially at such a high frequency <strong>¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
</strong></p><p>I started to become frustrated in high school when my friends were really lazy texters and would often respond with lackluster phrases like <em>'ohhh haha'</em>, or ‘<em>yeah’</em>, or one of the worst - ‘<strong>cool</strong>’. These frustrations continued to escalate in relationship after relationship until I came to the conclusion that texting was simply not sufficient enough. Sure, it may be good for quick exchanges of information, but when you use it as a crutch to hold up already weak and underdeveloped social abilities like I did for so long, it becomes a liability.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not even yet considering how many things go wrong over text. I’ve had multiple occasions where a friend misinterpreted what I was trying to say in a written message, and where the miscommunication on both ends just spiraled out of control. Why did I not quit texting after the first misinterpretation? I hated phone calls. I hated talking on the phone where there was that awkward unknowing feeling of what the other person was doing during the conversation since you were not both face-to-face. After I chose to take the spring semester off from school, I realized that I would have to do much more to keep up with my friends and family that do not happen to live way out in Oklahoma.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being out here for 2 days and trying to rely on my go-to texting method, I quickly realized that my relationships would <em>suffer greatly </em>if our only conversations were written and had very high latency between each message. As I do for many of my worldly questions, I looked to TED for inspiration concerning how people text and how to make it more meaningful, and aside from one video about society generally becoming less social as a result of social media, I didn’t walk away with much. As the best researchers of our day do, I went to Google. I simply Google-d ‘quitting texting’, and was presented with this <a style="color: crimson;" href="https://hellogiggles.com/lifestyle/quit-texting/" target="_blank">article </a>at the top of the page rank. In reading it, I didn’t know if I could say that I was as addicted to texting as the author was, given how readily and easily I threw it out of the window at the end of the night, but I resonated heavily with the statement,<strong><em> “... She wouldn’t pick up if I [called her]. Besides, everyone texts, no one calls me.”</em></strong> Only my family calls me. 
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have we given up the ability to hear each other's voices, laughs, cries, for some subpar set of emojis that don’t even come close to representing the nuances of the human spirit? I’m guilty as well for texting full essays when I’m excited or upset about something. Why would I continute to settle for sharing my excitement in a dull, dimensionless chat cell that is going to get scrolled past in a few more exchanges and possibly not recalled again for weeks or months or ever, when I could call up my friends and family and share my news aloud where we could interact like we would in person and live in the moment?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried this when I was offered the internship with Life.Church, and of the already low percentage of friends who actually picked up the phone, the general sentiment seemed to be <strong><em>“That’s awesome. Congrats, man… but… why didn’t you just text me this? This is kind of weird…”</em></strong> By the end of this article and reading through the author’s experience of giving up texting at first for a month, and then giving it up for good, I decided that this was a change that I needed to make for myself. My parents, being from the generation that they are from, happily embraced the change, whereas a decent number of my friends took the fact that I wouldn’t be texting for at least 30 days as <strong><em>“I’m going off the grid completely and don’t want to be reached for the next month,”</em></strong> which was ironically the complete opposite of what I was going for. This virtual reality will no longer be my reality, and though it won’t be as easy for my friends to make the change as it will be for me, I believe that my relationships will be all-the-more meaningful as a result.</p><p><br></p><p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><blockquote><li><strong>It’s easier and more effective to share God’s love aloud than through a text message
</strong></blockquote></li><blockquote><li><strong>More personal, human interactions</strong>- I feel closer to almost all of my friends and family after doing this challenge for 30 days, and I’m not looking back! Being able to hear the spirit in their voices makes all the difference in the world.
</blockquote></li><blockquote><li><strong>Respect for others’ time</strong>- Halfway through the challenge I found myself actually caring what people’s schedules were, what times they had set aside for leisure and talking, and what times they would be busy. This was something that I, and probably most people, had not considered before. The world of texting is such an on-demand paradigm, and once a message is sent, that imaginary timer starts ticking. Much like a bomb, as time wears on, the fuse grows shorter and the sender’s emotions become more intense. <strong>“Why haven’t they responded? Are they okay? Are they mad at me? Let me see if I said something that might have upset them… Oh shoot, I ended that sentence with a period, which obviously means that I am angry. I also forgot to put the :) emoji so they know that I’m just joking! I hope they don’t think I’m angry! I should text again just to make sure… It’s been like 45 minutes… maybe they are ignoring me… what’s their problem?”</strong> etc… Anyone else guilty of this? I don’t miss it.
</blockquote></li><blockquote><li><strong>(Hopefully) Less Social Awkwardness</strong>- Through voice-calling people, leaving voicemails, and learning to say things that I would normally only have texted, my social awareness has grown tremendously, and I feel much less awkward trying to communicate with both strangers and people that I am familiar with.
</blockquote></li><blockquote><li><strong>People appreciate the gesture of someone calling ‘just to check in’</strong>- If you just read that bold statement, do it. Call someone you haven’t spoken to in a while just to say ‘hi’. We never know what people are going through, and sometimes getting that random call from someone to say that they care can be just what they need. In my free time in the last 30 days, I wasn’t scrolling through Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook, or watching Netflix (or any variations thereof), I was calling up people in my contacts to see how their lives were going, even if we hadn’t spoken in a year. I checked in on several friends regularly to see how work or school was going. I reached out to people that I don’t talk to anymore because sometimes a person just needs someone to care about him or her. This wasn’t a part of the challenge, but it was a beautiful side effect that I encourage you to do as well. What do you have to lose?
</blockquote></li><blockquote><li><strong>We don’t need to text</strong>- As necessary as you might think texting is, it’s not.
</blockquote></li><blockquote><li><strong>Notification-free</strong>- Freeing oneself of notifications is one of the most socially liberating things we can do in the current cultural climate here in America (in my opinion, of course). Those of you who tried to text me during the challenge, I hope you enjoyed the autoresponder I set-up &gt;:-) Turning off notifications and setting the autoresponder to encourage people to call instead turned out to be a great idea. Releasing myself from the toxicity of constantly checking my phone for notifications was such a great experience because I was able to live life outside of that constantly “plugged-in’ mentality.
</blockquote></li><blockquote><li><strong>Free-time</strong>- During this 30 days I had a suddenly overwhelming amount of time for other things like praying, reading my bible, writing, working on my apps, and voice-calling people. You’d be surprised how much time we actually spend connected to our phones each day.
</blockquote></li><blockquote><li><strong>Real convos only</strong>- I love to talk to people, and by cutting out the fake communication, I had to resort to calling and having real vocal interactions if I wanted to stay connected. A few days before the challenge ended, I emailed a friend to clarify exactly what I was trying to accomplish here:
</blockquote></li><blockquote><strong>“I don't want to read your words because words on a screen could just as well belong to anybody, but if I hear your voice, even if I don't see you, that's real. That's real human communication. I don't want to read how things are going for you, I want to hear it. I want to hear your voice, your laugh, the uncertainty when you talk about something going on in your life, the worry, the angst, the happiness, the sadness, the raw human emotions that make us who we are."</strong></blockquote><blockquote><li><strong>Unpopular opinion</strong>- Not everybody was on board and eager to accept this challenge with me. I understand because I used to hate talking on the phone too, but I just despise texting even more.
</blockquote></li><blockquote><li><strong>Real-time</strong>- There is no delay in communication once you are on the phone. Most conversations will actually take less time if you just call than if you try to string the whole thing out over individual text messages.
</blockquote></li><blockquote><li><strong>Phone tag is still more personal than text tag.
</strong></blockquote></li><blockquote><li><strong>Better understanding</strong>- There’s much less room to misinterpret words when you can hear the actual vocal inflections from the person, rather than reading text and making your own conclusions.
</blockquote></li><blockquote><li><strong>Mental proximity</strong>- I miss my friends and family, but being able to hear their voices (and see them for the ones who video call) brings them so much closer, even if I am 1,400 miles from home and 1,600 miles from school.
</blockquote></li><blockquote><li><strong>My parents love to talk on the phone</strong>- as shown on the Wordclouds below.
</blockquote></li><blockquote><li><strong>Wordclouds are dope</strong>- True.
</blockquote></li><blockquote><li><strong>Active listening</strong>- Voice communication is a great way to practice active listening skills.
</blockquote></li><blockquote><li><strong>We can all do more to connect with our friends and family.
</strong></blockquote></li>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-12"><p style="font-size:1em">You can find the referenced videos at the bottom of this section, as well as linked to where mentioned</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my favorite things in the world is when a friend asks me, “Hey, do you have time to do something together this week?” and I respond, “I always have time.” In this life, we know we are given but a limited amount of time - time to live, to love, to laugh, and to make a positive impact on the planet. In this world, if nothing else, we have time. The poorest people in the world, just as well as the richest people, have time. So long as you are alive, you have time. People everywhere in the United States talk about how busy they are, how little time they have for certain things, and how they ‘wish they had time’ to do other things. One thing that people fail to realize is that <em><strong>time is a choice</strong></em>, and in terms of living the happiest life, science tells us that spending more time developing and enjoying our relationships is one of the best things that we can do.</p>
          </p><p>Healthy relationships are proven to be near, if not at the very top, of factors that contribute to the happiest lives. Here is a <a style="color:crimson;" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness?utm_campaign=tedspread--b&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare" target="_blank">TED Talk</a> that goes into detail as far as how we have come to this conclusion. Moving forward, knowing that relationships are the major key to happiness, why aren’t they a priority? </p><p>This past semester, though my thorough disillusionment with Harvard’s undergraduate education and traditional higher education in general may have something to do with it (more on that to come in a later post), I decided that people were more important than my school work. It probably seems a bit backwards, but it may have been the best decision I made this semester.</p><p>
            </p><p>What do I mean by 'people are more important than my school work', and what does that look like?</p><p>This means that if someone asks me to spend time with them, or conversely, if I want to spend time with someone, I will do it, regardless of whether I have an assignment or test coming up (unless, of course, I did not specifically want to talk to or spend time with that person at the time). If I happened to be working or studying and someone would want to interact, I would pause what I was doing and interact with them. If my friend came to me upset about something or was having a rough season of life, I would close my computer, put down whatever I was doing, and listen. If a friend came to me with good news, I would put my work on hold and share in their excitement in the moment. This philosophy made for the best relational semester I have had to date, and for more profound and satisfactory relationships than I have had thus far in college (in case you're keeping tabs, I'm 2 1/2 years in, currently taking the semester off to do an internship in Oklahoma, and plan on returning to school in the fall :-) ).</p><p>
            </p><p>For example, the night before my linguistics class’ final exam, I had studied a little bit, but really not enough to do well. This also happened to be the last available night that my Life Group could get together before I took off for 8 months, as well as the last night that one of my dearest friends was on campus before the holiday break. I knew that I had to study, but my relationships were and still are more important than any work - school or otherwise. I went to my Life Group, spent a few hours with all of the guys, and even got to show them one of my <a style="color:crimson; " href="https://elgindavis.github.io/trumpbump/" target="_blank">nonsense projects that I came up with while procrastinating</a>&nbsp;earlier that evening (works best on Google Chrome). We also got to watch a really cool cello performance from one of the guys, and another one even cooked up some pretty nice lamb and steak for us to share. Living in the moment and spending time with my Christian family was and will always be more important than any work. Given this same situation, many people today would likely say something like, "Sorry, guys, I don't have time tonight," and that would be false. You always have time, and you also have the choice of what you want to do with this time. After we wrapped up, I ran over to the dorm to catch up with my friend and say goodbye before she took off the next morning. In the back of my head, I still knew that I had to study for that final that was then in less than 12 hours, but as author Sebastian Faulks puts it beautifully, “You put your time where your priority is.” After engaging with all of these people and finally settling down to study, I did not feel a single bit of regret, remorse, or anxiety about time wasted, because there was none to be had. I sat down to study, and since I had been playing this game of relationships-over-school all semester, I had gotten it down to a science and had learned how to study and work effectively in a short amount of time. I studied diligently for a few hours, prayed about the exam, got a full night’s sleep (or as close to it as an insomniac can get), woke up in the morning and took the exam. The result of my exam happened to be the best grade that I've ever gotten on an exam since I started college, but that's beside the point.
            </p><p>So, what is the point of this story?
            </p><p>The point I want to make here is that our relationships define who we are. Our relationships have the power to make us happy. How we interact with each other and with the world is crucial to our perceptions and perspectives. We spend time on the things that we prioritize, and it’s as simple as that. <br><br><em>"Love like there is no tomorrow." </em></p><p>When it comes to the concept of ‘time’ in this country, a whole Pandora’s box of confusion unfurls, and people tend not to say what they truly mean or mean what they say. The most commonly alleged limiting factor in the development of relationships is time, which makes sense when considering the productivity-driven world that we live in. </p><p>There are 3 phrases that I hear far too often concerning a lack of time, and if I have ever despised anything (which, for the record, I have), I despise these phrases more than anything else, and here’s why:
            </p><p>1. <strong>“I’m too busy.”</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>“<em><strong>Too busy</strong></em> is a myth. People make time for the things that are really important to them.” - Mandy Hale
            </p><p>To say that you’re “too busy” to do something is really to say that you do not have the desire to do that thing in the near future. I hear this all the time around campus, both from people I know and from conversations that I overhear. Whether a result of impending problem sets, papers, exams or labs, people are always “too busy”. In a <a style="color:crimson; " href="https://www.ted.com/talks/laura_vanderkam_how_to_gain_control_of_your_free_time/details" target="_blank">TED talk </a>by time-management expert Laura Vanderkam, she breaks down the week of a full-time, working adult:
            </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24 hours/day x 7 days/week = 168 hours/week;
            </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40 hours/week spent working;
            </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56 hours/week spent sleeping (assuming you are among the few who actually sleep 8 hours per night);
            </p><p>This leaves most working adults with 72 hours/week (there is room here for people who work more than 40 hours/week to shift the numbers) of non-committed hours, until those hours are committed to doing whatever it is that the individual will choose to do with that time. If you really think you are “too busy”, consider what it is that you are doing with those 72 hours and analyze where you actually spend your time. </p><p>The breakdown may look a little different for college students, especially student-athletes, but even in my 2 years as a student-athlete, I spent at the maximum 35 hours per week in football training, meetings, practice, and games, if in-season, and I’m positive that I did not spend all of those 77 other hours per week in class, studying, participating in extracurriculars, or completing assignments. If you truly have time allotted for all of these 72-77 hours, then it is simply a matter of priority and what activities you choose to prioritize over others. In the event that you really allot every single available hour, whether to alone time, meditation, social interaction, sports, meals or what have you, it is better to say that you have allotted all of your time on a given day or given week, rather than to say that you are ‘too busy’ for someone and come off as indifferent.
            </p><p>2. <strong>“I don’t have time” </strong>In the same <a style="color:crimson; " href="https://www.ted.com/talks/laura_vanderkam_how_to_gain_control_of_your_free_time/details" target="_blank">talk </a>by Laura Vanderkam, she notes profoundly, “<strong><em>I don’t have time</em></strong> often means, <strong><em>It’s not a priority.</em></strong>” This brings back Faulks’ quote from above: “You put your time where your priority is.” If you “don’t have time” for something, you likely don’t want to be bothered by it and would rather not do it, rather than the case being that you literally are not able to spend the time it takes to do this activity. </p><p>Think about it this way - A friend asks you to help them clean out their garage this weekend, and you have time to help out. If you’re a good friend, you’ll probably agree and help out. If you really don’t want to do it, some might be blunt enough to simply reply “I don’t want to do that”, though most who don't want to partake would probably make some excuse along the lines of, “Sorry man, I’m swamped and I don’t really have any time this weekend, otherwise I totally would help out (lies).” Most people use the unavailability of time as an excuse to get out of things that they’d rather not do. Take the same situation, only this time, your friend phrases the question as such: “Hey man, I need some help cleaning out my garage this weekend, would you mind helping me out? I’ll give you $100,000.” If you are in the camp who originally said that they ‘don’t have time’ and you say that you still wouldn’t agree to help your friend now that there is money on the table, you’re probably not being very honest with yourself. The difference is not in the time that you very literally had available, it’s a matter of will. The fact of the matter is that if you truly want to do something, you will ‘have time’ for it and you will find a solution to get it done.</p><p>
            </p><p>3. <strong>“I’ll try to make time.”</strong> This is by far my least favorite and, in my opinion, the worst of the three phrases. In beginning  the phrase with the word ‘try’, the speaker is already half-heartedly committing, if not simply veiling a lack of desire, to accomplish the task, and probably really doesn’t care to do it in the first place. If anything can be gleaned from the two prior analyses, it is that you cannot “make time” for anything. You have a finite amount of time every day, every week, every month, every year, and that’s all you have until this life passes. </p><p>One interesting thing that I have noted in our society is that I have yet to hear about/of a single person on this planet saying things like, "You know, I think I need to <strong>make more time</strong> to go through every <strong>Snapchat story</strong> in my feed," or, "Man, I need to <strong>find time </strong>today to <strong>scroll through Instagram and like all these photos</strong>!" or even, "I wish I was able to <strong>make time</strong> today to <strong>find the dankest memes on Facebook</strong>", because people will <strong>always</strong> have time for the things they want to do. However, when asking people to <strong>spend time doing something to build relationships</strong> or to help someone with something, or really to do anything that does not <strong>pique their immediate interest</strong>, such as these addictive social media platforms are known to do, all of a sudden, the time is 'gone' and they have to <em>make</em>&nbsp;more of it or <em>find</em> it as if it had suddenly gone missing. Don't be fooled. Like I said, if you want to do it, you <em>will</em> have the time to do it. A lack of prioritization combined with a lack of accountability leads to many excuses, such as "trying to make time".</p><p>Another quote from Vanderkam goes as follows (I really liked that TED video), “... time is highly elastic. We cannot make more time, but <strong><em>time will stretch to accommodate what we choose to put into it</em></strong>,”(emphasis mine). One cannot “make” time to do anything, but given the valuable time that you have in this life, you can organize it, allot it, and manage it to do whatever you want to do with it. In my opinion, <strong>if you have to “make time” or "find time" for it, it is not something you value highly in the first place</strong>. Again, if it is something that you want, you <em>will </em>have time for it. </p><p>Sir John Lubbock, a banker, politician, scientist, and philanthropist from 19th century England noted, “In truth, people can generally make time for what they choose to do; it is not really the time but the will that is lacking.” Though he uses the phrase ‘make time’ here as most people do, what is key in this quote is the difference between the time available in a person’s life versus their will to do something.</p><p>
            </p><p>Of course, in all of these cases, as with anything, there are exceptions, but the general population takes advantage of the fact that people do not usually go any deeper when someone says that they are ‘busy’ or ‘don’t have time’, but I whole-heartedly challenge that tradition. Most of these issues could be resolved in as simple ways as an alteration in vocabulary, but within that alteration, a shift in mindset must also follow. <br>We so easily and often take for granted that there will be a "later" or a "next time", when neither is guaranteed in this fleeting life. <br><br>"Dream as if you'll live forever, 
Live as if you'll die today,
Love like there is no tomorrow."

            <p>I had given a beggar a bag of baguettes on my way to work Friday morning. This action wasn’t intended to make me feel good about myself or to earn any ‘Karma Points’ from the universe. Rather, it was intended to show someone, whom I had never met before and would likely never see again, the unfailing love and mercy of God that guides my life each day.</p><br><p> After doing this, I committed  myself to doing something like this every day for the rest of my stay in Paris- whether documented or undocumented.

To relieve someone who has been utterly defeated by the disparate cruelties of life by making an all-too-simple gesture. To show them that they are, in fact, as worthy of life as the rest of us, and that they can and should be valued by society.</p><br><p>
These people are forgotten each day as the "upstanding citizens" of the city pass them by, each in his or her own bubble of daily toil and, more often than not, ignorance. They fall by the wayside, are brushed off into the dust, and are swept away into the unfeeling gutters that they have no choice but to call home.<br><br>
Am I a bleeding heart that wants to give money that I don’t have to people that may spend it on human vices? <br><strong style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bolder;">No.</strong> <br> Can I empathize with these people who have lost everything, or who quite possibly never had anything to begin with?<br> <strong style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bolder;">Probably not.</strong> <br> Can I make an effort to show a stranger a simple kindness that probably seems almost as foreign to them as this country is to me?<br><strong style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bolder;">Absolutely.</strong> <br> And with this in mind, I continue.<br><br>

I had not helped anyone yet today, as I had really not even left the house until about 7pm (that’s another story), and here was my opportunity. I went back outside. <br>

I followed him inside the extravagant McDonald’s (France does McDonald’s much better than the U.S.), and on my way in, a young guy, maybe a few years older than myself, asked me if I was helping the man. <br>
<a style="font-style: italic;color:inherit;font-weight: bolder;" data-toggle="tooltip" data-delay='{"hide":"0"}' title="Yeah"> “Ouais.”</a><br> He reached into his pocket and gave me all of the Euro coins he had.<br>
<a style="font-style: italic;color:inherit;font-weight: bolder;" data-toggle="tooltip" data-delay='{"hide":"0"}' title="This is for him"> “C’est pour lui.”</a><br>
<a style="font-style: italic;color:inherit;font-weight: bolder;" data-toggle="tooltip" data-delay='{"hide":"0"}' title="Ah yeah, thanks"> “Ah ouais, merci.”</a><br>
The homeless man and I continued inside and went to one of the automated ordering machines. He looked at me. <br>
I said to him, <a style="font-style: italic;color:crimson;font-weight: bolder;" data-delay='{"hide":"0"}' data-toggle="tooltip" title="Whatever you want" > “Tout ce que vous voulez”.</a><a style="font-style: italic;color:;font-weight: bolder;" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/d9V-zUlrhEE" > (Sound familiar?)</a><br><br>
He wasn’t shy at all, that’s for sure. He ordered food for himself on the machine, and we went and waited for the food at the counter. I paid for the food, and the worker brought it out for him. The worker started to bring the food outside, urging the homeless man back into the chilly night.<br><br>
<a style="font-style: italic;color:inherit;font-weight: bolder;" data-delay='{"hide":"0"}' data-toggle="tooltip" title="Sir, he is with me, the receipt is for downstairs">“Monsieur, il est avec moi, le ticket est pour en bas.”</a> <br>
He stopped and looked at me for a second, and then walked the food downstairs, myself and my new friend just a few paces behind. The downstairs area was much less public than the main area, which meant that there were a lot less eyes on this man who probably hadn’t eaten a thing all day.<br> <br>
<a style="font-style: italic;color:inherit;font-weight: bolder;" data-delay='{"hide":"0"}' data-toggle="tooltip" title="Is it okay? Is it good?">“Ça va? C’est bon?” </a><br>
He had already started eating before I could finish the sentence. I smiled.<br>
<a style="font-style: italic;color:inherit;font-weight: bolder;" data-delay='{"hide":"0"}' data-toggle="tooltip" title="Do you want anything else? I have a baguette here if you want">“Voulez-vous des autres choses? J’ai une baguette ici si vous la voulez.”</a><br>
<a style="font-style: italic;color:inherit;font-weight: bolder;" data-delay='{"hide":"0"}' data-toggle="tooltip" title="No, it's okay, thanks">“No, ç’est bon, merci.”</a><br>
<a style="font-style: italic;color:inherit;font-weight: bolder;" data-delay='{"hide":"0"}' data-toggle="tooltip" title="Ok, enjoy, sir">“D’accord, bon appétit, monsieur”</a><br><br></span>
I climbed the stairs and sat at a table to continue waiting for my friend. <br><br>I looked at the receipt number- <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bolder;">ESP 56. </span>

a filtered lens,</p><p>A world where ignorance in its purest form truly is bliss,</p><p>A world wherein dreams do not amend.</p><p>Be wary of the stigmas, the norms, the do’s, the don’ts,</p><p>Lest you become a social pariah.</p><p>Be wary of the weapon you wield, the power you hold,</p><p>Lest They set your bones afire.</p><p>A bold, passionate Gale embodied by&nbsp;</p><p>Ribbons of cultured flesh</p><p>Is publicly feared by Them the most</p><p>And sets one apart from the rest.</p><p>He who conforms not to the Adversary’s wishes</p><p>But to those of He who gives life</p><p>Has a different filter with which to view the world,</p><p>But is subject to great burden and strife.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are those in the world</p><p>Who oppose the Gale at each turn.</p><p>There are those who wish to be the central star</p><p>Even if it means that the Earth itself must burn.</p><p><strong><em>The Hammer.</em></strong></p><p>The power to keep these souls in line,</p><p>The power better left to that of the Divine,</p><p>The power by which two fates may intertwine</p><p>Leaving the darkness reproached so that both souls may shine,</p><p>Be wary of the power of the Hammer.</p><p>Take not for granted the faculty it bears.</p><p>Take not for granted its righteous airs.</p><p>Take not for granted its inherent snares.</p><p>Take not for granted the power of the Hammer.</p><p>Presidence over the deeds of your peers</p><p>Is no way to wield the power,</p><p>Nor is blind hypocrisy, measured condemnation,</p><p>Or conservative silence as that of a coward.</p><p>Let the Gale within you take up its force</p><p>And drive you to make the effort.</p><p>Let it guide your mind and body to actions</p><p>That create a conscientious rapport.</p><p>Those who oppose still remain.</p><p>As society would have it, we should assess only those outside of our sphere-</p><p>The dogmatic demagogue, the fallen idol, the failed brigadier-</p><p>Because these views are valid in an otherwise filtered lens.</p><p>They live in an state of irrelevance whilst aligning with pop-culture trends.</p><p>A special state of irrelevance</p><p>Far enough removed to outwardly be condemned,</p><p>But never those within our sphere-</p><p>For those are the Untouchables.</p><p><strong><em>The Untouchables.</em></strong></p><p>The man drinking to forget the weight of the world and</p><p>The woman drinking away her sorrows,</p><p>The man drinking to be accepted and</p><p>The woman drinking to drown the thoughts of tomorrow,</p><p>The girl revealing all for the world to see</p><p>For the ephemeral thrill of validation-&nbsp;</p><p>The green-lensed shades coupled with the&nbsp;</p><p>Charming, forged smile prove to be enough</p><p>To beguile those who see no deeper than face value.</p><p>The Gale stirs within you and quells itself knowing that</p><p>Society does not approve its voice.</p><p>The girl who struggles to accept a compliment</p><p>Because “all guys have one thing on their mind”,</p><p>And the guy who substantiates this heavy claim</p><p>That counters the progress of mankind.</p><p>The pretenders, the exchangers of paltry pleasantries</p><p>Devoid of meaningful sentiment,</p><p>The malcontents who will never cease</p><p>To grouse about matters hardly pertinent,</p><p>Those who alter perception as a</p><p>Result of an opaque lens,</p><p>And will boldly disrespect the temple if</p><p>It means earning a new friend,</p><p>The students who study tirelessly for</p><p>The sole purpose of future earnings,&nbsp;</p><p>The businessmen who live lavishly while</p><p>Vagrants lie awake with bellies yearning,</p><p>Those who fall prey to the Adversary’s lust</p><p>And the various vices of human nature,</p><p>Those who believe the pleasures of physical&nbsp;</p><p>Intimacy supersede true happiness and Divine favor,</p><p>Those who steal, who cheat, who lie, and who kill,</p><p>Those who insult and belittle, who impose their will,</p><p>Those who denigrate and discriminate,</p><p>Those who instill fear and intimidate-</p><p>They are Untouchable.</p><p>The multifarious accounts of worldly transgression</p><p>Enrage the Gale beyond suppression,</p><p>But society has taught most of us well</p><p>How to contain our common microaggression.</p><p>Though the full power of the Hammer</p><p>Lies not in our hands,</p><p>This does not that imply that</p><p>We cannot take a stand,</p><p>For we are all imperfect bearers of the Hammer,</p><p>And as we grow we learn how best to control it.</p><p>The fervent spirit of the Gale lives within us all,</p><p>And as we grow we learn how best to uphold it.</p><p>Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom,</p><p>Let not the mighty man boast in his might.</p><p>Let not the Gale dominate your tongue,</p><p>Lest your cautions become fairly trite.</p><p>Untouchables despise the Hammer</p><p>For it boasts incandescent rays,</p><p>Dare not turn the Hammer on any one of them</p><p>Lest you welcome a loathsome gaze.</p><p>The Gale calls on you to swing</p><p>While They implore you to abate,</p><p>Your body continues to temporize</p><p>While the Hammer resigns Their grim fate.</p><p>Be wary of the power of the Hammer.</p><p>The Hammer has no darlings,</p><p>But its distinctions are made quite clear.</p><p>We and those within our sphere</p><p>Have been taught not to love but rather to fear</p><p>The high power of the mighty Hammer.</p><p>The Struggle rages on as that of a storm</p><p>And the Untouchable acts become the norm,</p><p>The bearers of the Hammer are driven to silence</p><p>And the voice of the Gale, Society decries it</p><p>Until the Grand Finale is upon us</p><p>And the true Hammer Bearer takes a stand.</p><p>He swings the Hammer righteously</p><p>And embraces the Gale at His right hand.</p></div>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 lead"><p>This phrase, of course currently living in Paris, brought me to a logical proceeding thought process concerning the infamous Champs-Élysées- a major boulevard in Paris and one of the most well known streets in the world. My following thought concerned the fact that not many people, myself included, know what Champs-Élysées actually means. To that end, not many care. And why should they? Either way, in searching for the meaning of Champs-Élysées, I came across the literal translation: Elysian fields. Again, who cares, and why should I? What is an “Elysian field” and why does its name embody one of the most well-known pieces of real estate in the whole world?&nbsp;</p><p>As ancient Roman and Greek history would have it, Elysian fields refer to the land of Elysium. Elysium is the place, in Greek mythology and the Roman conviction, reserved for the “deserving dead”.&nbsp;</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 lead"><p>The souls of fallen heroes and only the most worthy mortals would come to rest here in the blissful, eternal paradise of the Elysian fields, or in french, les Champs-Elysées. In those days, Elysium was as close as one could get to heaven, and equally, it was as far as one could get from the eternal flames of L’Enfers - Hell. Elysium was the place at which every soul longed to come to rest and behold in all its splendor.</p><p>People come from all over the world to see les Champs-Élysées, the Elysian fields, the glimmer of hope for eternal bliss in a such a dreary and gruesome world - to see paradise. In consciousness, people come to the site maybe to mark it off of a bucket list, or maybe just to take in the classic architecture, but within the separate consciousness of the soul, the real story may be more significant than we have been made to realize.</p><br>
