            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><strong>Idea/Concept:</strong></p><p>Foxy Birds is an endless-runner style iOS game that I created and released in June of 2018. I developed and designed the entire game from scratch to gain experience in taking a game from idea to market. My main focus was to quickly create an enjoyable gaming experience catering to a certain demographic, and also to learn more about the process of design, development, and production -especially as they relate to video games.</p><p>When first starting the project, I had the idea of creating a Flappy Bird-style game wherein the player controls the fox character in a consistent space as the environment moves from right to left. The goal of the game is to eat as many birds as possible to earn points while staying out of the water below.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Major Design Choices:</strong></p><p>Ensuring that background components are visually distinct from foreground, interactive components.</p><p>The water at the bottom of the screen moves so that the player knows that some interaction is to be had with this water, and after touching it once and seeing "Game Over", it can be gleaned simply enough that touching the water is the way that the player "dies" in the game.</p><p>Opting for a simple banner tutorial - instead of implementing a whole tutorial session, I opted for a simpler, comparatively effective set of banners that appear at the beginning of each session with the simple instructions.</p><p>Using visual components from other projects - for this project I used different pieces of vector art I had made from various places of self-study, rather than creating all-new assets, in an effort to focus on the experience and gameplay and get quicker feedback from play-testers.</p><p>Only using two different screens for the gameplay, simplifying the game from the initial list of bigger-scale features for the MVP</p><p>Ensuring music is optional - although it might seem obvious, some games don't give the player an accessible place within the game to turn the sound off</p><p>Using analog controls for horizontal movement instead of left and right buttons</p><p>Using transparent controls instead of opaque controls for maximum visibility of gameplay</p><p>Simple scoring system</p><p>Allowing the character to exit the screen without necessarily dying</p><p>Sizes of the platforms with respect to the screen and character sizes - the platforms could not be too small for the character to jump on, or too big and take up too much visual real estate</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Process:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Defining and Designing the Experience:</strong></p><p>At the outset of the project I searched for a while for simple games styles that would be quick and simple to make, and decided on the classic endless-runner style as a starting point. After nailing down my game experience idea, I began to wireframe on paper and flesh-out all of the details that I wanted to add. A crucial learning that came here was the understanding of the difference between features that are absolutely necessary for the minimum viable product, and the nice-to-haves/bells and whistles that make a game fantastic. The wireframes shown below show the early ideation process of the game's design - from having a full-blown in-game shop, complete with a power-up store, a place to unlock new characters and character outfits, and an in-game currency to allow me to later insert rewarded video ads for unobtrusive monetization, to having both arcade and story modes, achievements, badges, leaderboards, and social connections. All of these things would make great additions to the game and would really help in creating a complete and next-level game, but I decided to add these to the back-burner for a later point in time when I had more time and resources to fully realize all of these goals.</p><p>After coming up with an idea for a simple game of this nature, I began to design the main character, known by some as Shadow the Fox. I played around with a few ideas for characters until ultimately settling on Shadow, and then made a few vectorized animation cycles for his idle, walking, and jumping states. When I finished the animations, I brought them into Godot (the game engine that I used for Foxy Birds) to find any hitches in the movement and iterated on these animations until they were smooth enough to move on. The rest of the assets were pretty simple to design, because I used some different vector images that I had created in some self-study to act as the obstacles that Shadow would interact with throughout the game. Aside from the main character, all of the assets in the game are assets that I had made at some other point in time that I used in an effort to save time and expedite this stage of the game production process.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Play-testing and Feedback:</strong></p><p>As soon as I had completed the game cycle, I began to play-test the game with people I knew so that I could get a feel for how people would react to it and how intuitive the gameplay should be. The biggest issues that were noted in the initial build were the difficulty of the game, target demographic, incentives and the original control mechanisms.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Adjusting the difficulty:</strong></p><p>The game is played by jumping across various moving platforms while trying to stay out of the water below, and the twist is that the differently-sized birds that fly by are the only way to score points. Not only do you have to stay alive, but in order to actually gain points, you have to jump out of your comfort zone fairly often and go for those birds. I learned from a number of testers early on that these two components combined were pretty stressful, given how fast the platforms were moving. I noted these comments and slowed down the platforms and adjusted the player speed accordingly to make it more reasonable to accomplish the goal - at least in the first few levels until the difficulty starts slowly ramping back up.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who wants to play Foxy Birds?</strong></p><p>Having gone into the process without any idea who might like the game or who I intended for my target audience to be, I asked anybody and everybody I knew to play-test the game and give constructive feedback. I quickly learned that everybody has different ideas of what they want from your game, what your game should be like, and what it should do, but ultimately as the artist and creator, I had to learn to filter unhelpful and helpful feedback and change and adapt with what I felt would be best for the game and the general target end-user. In asking all of these different people from such different age categories, I found that the older generations were completely lost on how to play the game. Through further observation and analysis, I realized that they did not grow up playing standard games with a "joystick" and jump-button layout, so they were very confused on how to actually move and maneuver the character. Some were not even able to tell that when they moved the analog that the character moved across the screen, which was another very perplexing finding. However, when testing with people my age and younger, the same controls seemed to be much more intuitive and natural, and it turns out that the only demographic that I did not test - that of children under 12 - seemed to enjoy the game the most.</p><p>Given that I don't personally know many children under 12 years old, it made sense why they were overlooked, but this oversight completely changed my perception of my creation. It was only after releasing the game in the iOS App Store that I learned from people I knew, who happened to be parents of kids in that age range, that their kids loved playing the game. They would tell me how they had several games on their phones for their kids to play but the kids always wanted to play Foxy Birds. Beyond the warm fuzzy feeling of knowing that someone really likes and appreciates your work, knowing that you made a positive impact on someone's child's life - one that isn't riddled with ads and frustrating in-app purchase scams - made the project seem all-the-more-worthwhile.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Besides that, I learned how powerful it is to make not only a game, but an experience. An experience where people can immerse themselves and just enjoy something pure and without worry. I also learned to never overlook demographics when testing games, because the ones that you least expect to be your market can turn out to be your biggest fans.</span><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Learning Through Feedback:</strong></p><p>When play-testing in the game engine on my computer, I actually had someone tell me that they would like to use the space bar to jump in the game, even though the game was being made for iPhone and iPad. So I learned that not everybody's feedback is helpful, though it is appreciated either way. In my haste to get feedback, I had people test the game as early as possible so as not to pursue a path that would not lead to good results, but in understanding the process better now, I believe it would have been a better choice to have waited until the initial build was complete and ready for iOS TestFlight. Finding good, helpful feedback is key in the development cycle, and through research and studying the design process, I learned how important it was to get not just any feedback, but the right feedback early in the process.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Control:</strong></p><p>With respect to the initial controls, I was using a left-arrow button and a right-arrow button, both situated on the left side of the screen, to control movement with a singular jump button on the right. In play-testing the controls I learned a number of things that proved to be helpful as feedback. While these controls got the job done, they required the player to pick up their thumb frequently when they wanted to change direction or stop moving. This also limited the player from moving the character at any speed other than 0 or full speed. The player would also have to often look down at the controls to be sure that their thumb was correctly placed on either direction, and this is a game where the player really cannot afford to break focus.</p><p>I overcame this obstacle by implementing an analog functionality, that not only allowed the player to simply keep their thumb pressed down throughout the duration of the game, but they were also then able to fluctuate the character's speed between 0 and the maximum, and the control also became semi-transparent so the background could be seen when the thumb was dragged away from the control itself. These changes provided for a more natural and comfortable user experience.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Incentivizing the game:</strong></p><p>Through some initial play-testing, I found that the game had no real incentive for the user to continue playing round after round. I noted this as a valuable piece of knowledge that underlies pretty much all great games, and learned how important it is to create an experience for the user to want to engage in continuously, so I decided to play into the natural human affinity for competition and added a high score feature, which made all the difference. I could have gone further to implement the other back-burner items mentioned near the top of the process, but I decided that it was more important at this stage to continue as planned to get the MVP of the game to market within a few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Optimizing Player Learning:</strong></p><p>At the beginning of development, it seemed intuitive to me that given controls to move and jump with a character, the player would slowly learn through a few trials that they can move and jump, have to stay on the platforms and out of the moving water. Once the player was able to master the basics, they could begin to venture further in their experience and begin to eat birds as they flew by to start gaining points and amassing a high score. My inspiration for this method was taken from classic Mario where no instructions were given, and the player realizes that the only way to go is right, and slowly but carefully learns about the enemies and power-ups throughout the world through the process of discovery. After a few testers reported to not have readily understood the goal of the game, I implemented a simple three-banner tutorial that would tell the player what to do (eat the birds) and what not to do (fall in the water), saving time and resources, as opposed to having implemented a whole tutorial session to convey the same simple information.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Major Learnings/Takeaways:</strong></p><p>Figure out target demographic early on in the design process to design for your audience, given that it may be much more difficult to get constructive feedback from people outside of your target audience</p><p>Researching similar game styles and examples is always a good way to gain inspiration and find out exactly what you want to create</p><p>Things that are intuitive to one person may not necessarily be intuitive to all people</p><p>If your game is too difficult, many people will not want to play it. Know your audience.</p><p>Visual elements do not have to be very complicated to create a functional design and immersive ecosystem</p><p>Competition will drive engagement</p><p>There are many good games out there, so people need an incentive to play and continue to play your game</p><p>It is very important to visually distinguish interactive elements from the background elements</p><p>The player controls can make or break a game - if players cannot easily understand how to play the game, and then how to succeed and win, they will put the game down, delete it, and move on to something less frustrating</p><p>Teaching the player to play your game is crucial in the first 10 minutes of interaction - you should capture their attention, make them confident that they can become really good at the game, and give them a reason to come back and play time and time again</p><p>Love what you do and enjoy making people smile!</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for reading, and be sure to check out Foxy Birds for iOS devices <a href="http://bit.ly/foxy-birds" target="_blank">here</a>!</p><p>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>My Daily Bread</strong> is a mobile app developed in Ionic to allow Christians to take notes on certain scriptures as they engage with the Word of God every day.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><strong>Problem:</strong> </div><div>Lack of ability to take notes while reading scripture and have them with you at all times in most forms of reading and studying scripture</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Solution:</strong></div><div> create a mobile app with the full text of the bible where the user can pair a section of scripture from any chapter with their specific reflections.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Process:&nbsp;</strong></div><div>I started the designing of the app by thinking through all of the different possibilities of screens of the app and their various uses. The key step here was to differentiate the <strong>minimum viable product features</strong> (ability to read scripture, add a reflection entry for those verses, edit basic account info, sign up and sign in, recover forgotten password, view list of entries, view specific entry details, select a chapter, etc) from the nice to have features (saving prayers, community-driven prayer, sermon notes, etc).&nbsp;</div><div>After narrowing down my scope, I wireframed the screens I wanted to use and drew connecting arrows to show the user flow and possible actions that the users may take in navigating the app. I continued to refine this flow until I landed on a flow that appears minimal enough to let the user take full control of their experience.</div><div>Designing transitions was more interesting, because of the discrepancies between the common footer navbar on iOS and android, but ultimately I decided to adhere to the iOS standard of changing screens instantly without transition so as to remain coherent and consistent with the experience and the user's expectations.&nbsp;</div><div>The color scheme for the app, having a contrasting red and blue theme was an interesting way that I found to play on the idea of passion and calmness, energy and peacefulness, and just an overall increase in emotional engagement with the scriptures. The background of the text is slightly yellow and also slightly transparent so as not to strain the reader's eyes when trying to read scripture even late at night.&nbsp;</div><div>For the most part, I opted for a simplistic interface, using color to add a sense of fullness to the designs of the various sections of the app.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Technical:</strong></div><div>I considered the possibilities of storing everything locally versus storing information in the cloud, and I concluded that local storage for the actual entry information was too volatile, seeing as a user can clear the whole phone and lose all of their data, or get a new phone and not have access to any of their saves reflections. So I then decided to research some different cloud storage options, and landed on Google Firebase as my best option for its flexibility and size of the database. Every user would sign up for the app, saving email and password, and all of their entries would be saved to their personal, randomized userID key in the database.</div><div>I decided on Ionic as the framework of choice for this project because making an Ionic app requires a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and I already had experience with all three. In addition, Ionic allows for deployment of a mobile app to both iOS and Android from a single code base, though there are obviously performance and customization tradeoffs between native and cross-platform development.</div><div><br></div><div>Data objects - I decided to use an open source version of ESV and store it inside the app so that the app would not require internet connectivity to read scripture.&nbsp;</div><div>The entry objects hold some basic metadata for each entry like the date of creation, associated passage, and the user's reflections.</div><div><br></div><div>Check out My Daily Bread on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-daily-bread-mdb/id1363680631?mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a> or on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ionic.mydailybreadprod" target="_blank">Google Play</a>!</div></div>
